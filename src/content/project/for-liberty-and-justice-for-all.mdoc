For Liberty and Justice for All was my drawing. The basis for this assignment was to take a concept or construct and showcase our opinion on it. Before starting our drawing, we were expected to research our topic to enable us to infuse more meaning into our drawing. The topic I chose was the Pledge of Allegiance. The pledge was first written and integrated into schools in 1982 as a part of a marking campaign run by The Youth Champion magazine. During the 50s in the height of the Cold War the line “under God” was added to distinguish the US from communist countries. The pledge was eventually unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment, so the pledge was made non-mandatory in public schools. My drawing reflects my idea of the pledge of allegiance based on the line “for liberty and justice for all” as a person of color. My final drawing makes a nod toward racism and the capitalist origin of the pledge. In addition to referencing American beauty standards and kneeling as a form of protest.
