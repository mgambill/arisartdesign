For my Design final, we were tasked with creating miniature non-functioning pinball machines. For the finished, the
machines were built out of plywood and included lights, theoretical gameplay, and an original concept. Last Man Standing
is a post-apocalyptic-themed game where players try to survive after a nuclear disaster.

The objective of Last Man Standing is to collect all the resource boxes and get to the underground bunker while avoiding
all the traps and debris. The game board has two layers that separate the outside and the bunker. The game board,
cabinet, and circuiting were all designed by me. The images on the right showcase some of the original concept sketches
for the outer cabinet design.
